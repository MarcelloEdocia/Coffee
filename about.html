	<h1 style="text-align:center;">About Us</h1>
	<p >It happens millions of times each week – a customer receives a drink from a Starbucks barista – but each interaction is unique..
Starbucks Front Of Original Pike Place Store
It’s just a moment in time – just one hand reaching over the counter to present a cup to another outstretched hand.

But it’s a connection...

We make sure everything we do honors that connection – from our commitment to the highest quality coffee in the world, to the way we engage with our customers and communities to do business responsibly.

From our beginnings as a single store over forty years ago, in every place that we’ve been, and every place that we touch, we've tried to make it a little better than we found it.</p>
